GUI Assignment #9

ASSIGNMENT WRITE UP:
Currently the scrabble game seems to be working properly, and all of the "basic functionality" features and "additional functionality" features (not the extra credit features) have been properly implemented. The drop grid to which the tiles snap to is a bit off but this is a small issue and does not ruin the playability of the game any. Otherwise I am unaware of other issues which the game may have, and from testing seems to be working properly based on the requirements stated in the assignment details.
